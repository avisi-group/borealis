//! Interface to OCaml runtime infrastructure
//!
//! Due to an issue with <https://github.com/zshipko/ocaml-rs> not supporting multithreaded
//! environments, all interaction with OCaml objects *must* occur on a single
//! worker thread.
//!
//! For example, in `load_files`, the String returned by
//! `internal_process_file_load_files` is safe to cross the interface boundary
//! (in `Response::LoadFiles`) but the AST and type environment of type `Value`
//! is *not* safe to send across the interface. Doing so will result in a
//! `SIGSEGV: invalid memory reference`
