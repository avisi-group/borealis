/// and `right` go through.
///
/// When emitting BOOM, we could recurse into each sub-tree when emitting
/// if-statements. This is *correct* but results in an explosion, all blocks in
/// each left and right body after the if-statements original scope are
/// duplicated, and this occurs for every if-statement.
///
/// Instead, if we can find the point at which the branches re-join, we can emit
/// only the minimum number of statements in the left and right bodies of the
/// if-statement, and return one indendation level. This avoids the duplication
/// explosion.
///
/// However, finding the block where branches re-join is non-trivial. We need to
/// find all paths from the left and right blocks, then find the first (closest)
/// block which appears in all such paths. Finding all paths first quickly
/// exhausts available memory, so the current implementation iteratively grows
/// all paths in lock-step, searching for common blocks each time.
///
/// The problem is that it still consumes too much memory on larger graphs. At
/// the time of writing, this was solved by culling paths which re-join. I
/// thought about it for a while and I think it's correct, but who knows?
