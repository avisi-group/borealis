## Build Requirements

* [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs)
* [OCaml toolchain](https://ocaml.org)
* [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
* [GMP](https://gmplib.org)
* [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org)
* [Dune](https://dune.build)
* [`sail` opam package](https://opam.ocaml.org/packages/sail/)

## Testing

`cargo test --release` to run all tests.

## Docker

The included `Dockerfile` builds, tests, and generates documentation for `borealis`. It is used by the GitHub Actions workflow for CI. For that reason, the Docker image should always be `x86_64` compatible, while `aarch64` (and non-Linux) support will be provided on a best-effort basis.

## Workspace Packages

### `borealis`

Sail frontend to GenSim. Depends on `sail` crate to parse Sail definition, which is then compiled to GenC.

### `sail`

Rust interface for the the [Sail compiler and AST](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~pes20/sail/) written in OCaml.

### `common`

Rust does not support cyclic dependencies among crates so this crate contains types and logic shared by multiple other crates in the workspace.

### `libarch-sys`

Rust wrapper around the GenSim-emitted C++ source. Currently used for debugging instruction decoder and disassembler.

## Common Issues

### Linker Errors

Typically Rust programs benefit from a high degree of portability, unfortunately by depending on the Sail library `borealis` has a more complex linking situation. The `sail` crate contains an OCaml library called `wrapper`. This is built with the `build.rs` script in `sail`. `wrapper` depends on the Opam `sail` package, which depends on `conf-gmp` (a virtual Opam package relying on the system GMP library installation).

On several systems we have experienced linker errors relating to GMP as `conf-gmp` does not add the correct paths to the shared libary search paths. Building GMP statically and manually exporting the path to the object file does work, however we elected to add the `gmp` Opam package as a dependency to the `wrapper` library, as even though `sail` Opam package does not use it in any way, it sets the correct paths used by OCaml allowing `conf-gmp` to build successfully.

Additionally, on macOS, `-lgmp` must be supplied as well as the path to the Homebrew `/lib` folder, which is done in the `build.rs` inside conditional compilation flags.

### Missing Opam/Dune Binaries

If the `opam` or `dune` binary is not in `PATH` then you may experience the following errors in `ocaml-rs` or `sail` respectively:

```

```

To fix, ensure the `opam` and `dune` binaries are installed and made available to the environment in which you are compiling. For example, when using `rust-analyzer` in VSCode, you may want to launch VSCode from the command line prefixed with `eval (opam env)`, as opening it as an application may not result in the `PATH` being updated.
